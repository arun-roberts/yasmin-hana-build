        a: ['My services are not exclusive to any gender, age (as long as you’re over 18), sexuality, ethnicity, etc. As a queer woman and person of colour, I enjoy meeting all kinds of different people. I understand how to create safe spaces and will ensure that you feel respected and welcomed in my company. In return, I’ll expect politeness and respect from you. I’m also happy to talk to you about ways we might create a comfortable space to accommodate neuro-divergence.']

        q: 'What do you expect from your clients?',
        a: [
            'Enthusiastic consent is not just an important part of every one of my sessions, but something I find especially sexy. Specifically with kink, this means that we will speak about boundaries and expectations prior to a session. These chats are a great way to get us both in the mood and excited for our adventures together. It’s also important to remember that consent is ongoing, and can be given and revoked at any time. So I’ll be checking in with you throughout our session.',
            'I get regular STI checks every 3 months and expect that you would have also recently been tested before seeing me. I also hold my clients to a high standard of personal hygiene and would expect that you have showered immediately prior to our session.'

        q: 'I’m feeling super nervous, is this normal?',
        a: ['Whether it is your first time seeing a SW, your first sexual experinece, or your 100th, it is perfectly normal to feel nervous and this is something that happens to all of us. I feel honoured to be a part of your journey and the nerves can even make the experience more exciting. We can take things at whichever speed we are comfortable with.']

        q: 'I would love to see you, but I’m a little unsure which service to choose.',
        a: ['I’m super excited that you’d like to spend time with me, but you don’t have to know what you’re looking for. If you have read my pleasure menu (link) and still don’t quite know what you’d like, send me a message (link) and we can discuss options together. We can always go with the flow and work it out during our time together. ']
